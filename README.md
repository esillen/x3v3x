3v3 space shooter

Super cool game made for the arcade table.

## Note

Don't use the new input system.

## Required assets

You will need to install the following free assets from the Unity Asset Store to compile the game:

- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/cartoon-fx-remaster-free-109565
- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/volumetric-lines-29160
- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/starfield-skybox-92717
- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/low-poly-spaceships-set-209758

You will also need to import TMP Essentials when prompted.


The game will not compile when you start up and you need to resolve the missing assets first. Start in safe mode and ignore the errors until everything is imported.
